# Idea for Code.Fun.Do++ 2019

The theme for this year codefundo++ is Securing Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain.

We did research on the condition of Electronic Voting in India and came up with following:

Problem-We found that an attacker with brief access to EVMs can tamper with votes and potentially change election outcomes. We demonstrate two attacks that involve physically tampering with the EVMsâ€™ hardware. First, we show how dishonest election insiders or other criminals could alter election results by replacing parts of the machines with malicious look-alike parts. Such attacks could be accomplished without the involvement of any local poll officials. Second, we show how attackers could use portable hardware devices to change the vote records stored in the machines. This attack could be carried out by local election officials without being detected by the national authorities or the EVM manufacturers. Safeguards against these attacks are either absent or woefully inadequate.

Solution-We propose that every EVM will be made a node, combined and connected with a BLockchain network which will be deployed using Azure Blockchain. By this, external tampering of EVMs will be stopped as all the data will be kept secured in the blockchain network. EVMs will only be operational during the Voting time and it will automatically turn off once the voting period is over. This will not only ensure that all EVMs start to fucntion at the same time but it also make sure that no extra time will be given to make forge votes. Also, voting will only be counted from the verified voter id data, which is already stored in the network. This will give flexibility to the voter to vote from anywhere and also no forge voting could be done against false voter id. By this way, we can make a pan voters network spread across all over the nation which will secure the Electronic Voting and hence a crystal clear Election can successfully take place.

Thanks.
